## Building and deploying the application

### Dependencies

The project is dependent on other Civil Damages repositories:
- [civil-damages-ccd-definition](https://github.com/hmcts/civil-damages-ccd-definition)
- [civil-damages-camunda-bpmn-definition](https://github.com/hmcts/civil-damages-camunda-bpmn-definition)

To set up complete local environment for Civil Damages check [civil-damages-sdk](https://github.com/hmcts/civil-damages-sdk)

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution (created in `build/install/unspec-service` directory)
by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4000` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:4000/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```

### Preview environment

Preview environment will be created when opening new PR.
CCD and Camunda BPMN definitions will be pulled from the latest GitHub releases.
